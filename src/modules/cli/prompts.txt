The first thing you'll want to do is find out where you are. Do this by typing 'pwd'
To find out what's in the 'present working directory (pwd)', type 'ls'
Using the 'tree' command is an easy way to see the files past the current directory. Try it!
We can move into any of these directories by typing 'cd <directoryName>'
If you want to move backwards you can run 'cd ..'
Lots, if not most, commands come with extra options. You can usually see them by adding '--help' after it
Run 'tree --help', and look for the '-P' option. After reading what it does, try it!
Seeing the contents of files is as easy as typing 'cat', followed by the filename
If you want to search that output for specific text, you can chain 'cat' to 'grep' like: 'cat <file> | grep <text>'
In fact, you can chain together lots of commands in the same way. Try 'tree | grep <something>'
