The first thing you'll want to do is find out where you are. Do this by typing 'pwd'
To find out what's in the 'present working directory (pwd)', type 'ls'
Using the 'tree' command is an easy way to see the files past the current directory. Try 'tree .'
Seeing the contents of files in a directory is as easy as typing 'cat', followed by the filename
If you want to search that output for specific text, you can chain 'cat' to 'grep' like: 'cat <file> | grep <text>'
